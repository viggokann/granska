Building requires the following packages to be installed on
your machine:
g++, makedepend, flex, bison and xerces-c

To build run 'make' and install the library with 'sudo make install'.

This will create two executables: scrutinizer and testlibrary;
and a dynamic library: 'granska'.
'scrutinizer' is the actual granska program and 'testlibrary' is
a small program that makes use of the library 'granska'.
To run a test to see that testlibrary works, run
'make test'

Before you run the programs you must run the script 'setEnv.sh'. 
run it as: . setEnv.sh 
Note the space after the dot. If not used, the variables will only
be set within the sript setEnv.sh.

------- CGI-Granska -------------
When building cgi-granska (wwwscrutinizer):
* If you want to debug, remember to remove the line "strip
wwwscrutinizer" from the Makefile.
* Comment out the flags $(PROBCHECK_FLAGS) $(WEB_FLAGS) from ALL_FLAGS
and -DDEVELOPER_OUTPUT from SCRUT_FLAGS
* The locations of the rule file, the tagger lexicon files, example sentences file, and rule file when adding user created rules all used to be hardcoded in wwwmain.cpp and wwwscrutinizer.c but these have now been moved to the Makefile. The TAGGERLEXICONFOLDER, EXAMPLESENTENCESFILE, DEFAULTRULEFILE, and STAVALEXICONFOLDER need to be set to the correct file system locations before compiling.
* If the rulefile does not have a stored .opt file, wwwscrutinizer
needs write permission in the folder of the rulefile the first time it
runs or you will get a segmentation fault. A quick way to avoid
problems is to run wwwscrutinizer once as root (sudo), but when
running as root wwwscrutinizer needs to have something to scrutinize
or it will not even try to load the rule file. Similarly, if there are
no "fast" files for the tagger lexicon files, the wwwscrutinizer will
try to write such files and fail if write permission is not given.

------- Parser version of Granska -------------
When using Granska for parsing, you need to compile the scrutinizer
with -DDEVELOPER_OUTPUT.

You also need to give lots of extra options when running the program:

./scrutinizer.parse -Cb 1 -Cr /home/jsh/servergranskafiles/servergranska/lexikon/tags/repr.ptt -w parse 6127 public parse -Ch 4 -CH 3 -J none 0 2

Here is a simple example rule to test the "use my own rules" for the CGI version of Granska:
